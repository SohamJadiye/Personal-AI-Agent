# Personal-AI-Agent
-Project Overview: A web-based voice assistant built with Flask that allows users to speak or type queries, processes audio input, recognizes speech, and provides intelligent responses both as text and audio played directly in the browser.

-Web Framework: Flask â€“ used to create the web server, handle routes, serve HTML pages, and manage POST/GET requests.

-Speech Processing: SpeechRecognition for converting user audio to text and pydub for audio format conversion (e.g., WebM to WAV).

-Natural Language & Computation: WolframAlpha API (or other LLM APIs) to process user queries and return structured responses.

-Audio Response & UI: Web Speech API (SpeechSynthesis) to play assistant responses as audio in the browser, combined with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a full-screen chat-like interface with voice input and output.
